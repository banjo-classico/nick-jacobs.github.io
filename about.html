                <h3>What came before?</h3>
                    <p>I was brought up in Wellington, but have been living in Auckland or other parts of the world for a few years now.</p>
                    <p>I studied first at Victoria, and then later at University of Auckland, doing a Masters of Speech Language Therapy Practice.</p>
                <h3>What brought me to EDA and web development?</h3>
                    <p>I was lacking passion for my work and my career and was looking for something to really get my teeth into. I wanted something with creativity, flexibility and career growth, and realised web development was all that. Once I found EDA and got a feel for the inclusive and supportive culture there, I knew that's what I was going to do.</p>
                <h3>Where do I want to go?</h3>
                    <p>Right now I see so many possibilities out there that could shift and change as time goes on. I'm happy putting my head down and focusing on gaining knowledge and skills, and then seeing how things lie.</p>

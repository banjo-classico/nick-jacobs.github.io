                <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is dividing the webpage into even sections of columns to form a grid, which is then useful to help structure elements on the page. Sections of a grid and have smaller grids within them also.

                <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
                <p>
                    People access the internet on so many different kinds of devices, which have different sized screens. Webpages need to be able to change and adapt to any sized screen, so the user still has a good experience of the page.
                </p>
                <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
                <p>
                    Organising and structuring html code so that tags reflect the differing importance of the elements on the page.
                </p>
                <h3>Anything else interesting?</h3>
                <p>
                    I really liked learning about grid design and think it will make designing pages much easier. Also, I didn't know about Google Fonts, and now I'm obsessed.

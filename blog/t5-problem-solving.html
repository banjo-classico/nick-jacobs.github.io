                    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
                    <h4>This one time at code camp...</h4>
                    <p>
                        ...where I got stuck on a problem. It's actually happened many more than just the one time. But the most recent was in making this racer game. I'd spent a fair while trying to programme it and for some unknown reason my javascript just was having no effect on my page. After trying a few different things, including using my face on the keyboard, I decided to sleep on it because it was late and I was having trouble concentrating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next day I attacked the problem again. I wrote out some pseudocode, just so I could clarify in my mind what it was exactly that I was trying to achieve, then I added some code to that would put on the screen some of the outputs of the different steps in my code. For some reason this wasn't working the night before but did work the second day. Don't ask me why. Maybe I was too tired the first time and was making a mistake that I couldn't see. In any case, the printing out of the steps allowed me to see what my code was actually doing and to pinpoint the place where it was falling down. I was able to fix that and then my code all came together relatively quickly after that. Success!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess I learned that if I've been tackling a problem for a while with no headway, then taking some time out away from the problem can be really beneficial. Especially if I'm tired.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How confident are you using problem solving techniques?</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are some techniques that I'm not confident using, or that I don't find effective right now. These include pseudocode, and just trying something. I will certainly use both of these techniques, but my limited knowledge of coding means that they are not often very effective (because I often don't know what to try!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Techniques I find better are definitely Googling (hallelujah!) and console.logging. I'm pretty good at googling the right things to find something that will help me. And console.logging helps me keep track of what is going on in my code.
                        I don't mind asking peers for help either, but prefer to try to fix it myself first. But chatting about a problem with someone can aid learning for both people, and sometimes save a lot of time.

                    <h4>What do the following methods do? </h4>
                    <p>
                        <span style="bold">.map()</span> - when this method is used on an array, it applies a given function to each value in that array, and takes the result of each of those computations and puts them into another array.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="bold">.filter()</span> - this method will apply a function onto each element of the array, and create a new array with all those values which passed the conditional test of the function (e.g. is larger than 10)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="bold">.reduce()</span> - this method applies a function to each element in the array, but uses the result of the previous function call as the first value in the next call. This allows one to reduce an array of numbers down to a single number for example.

                      Scope is a term used to describe the extent from which a declared variable is able to be accessed. Although there are several types of scope, javascript uses only two: global scope and local scope.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A variable with global scope is able to be accessed anywhere within the code, it effectively has global reach. Conversely, a variable with local scope can only be used within a certain environment. An attempt to access the variable from outside this environment would result in an error, as from outside the variable doesn't exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You could imagine scope as a mafia empire. All the information at street level, all the money in the shops, the everyday comings and goings of citizens, it is all accessible by anyone, from the mafia Boss, to the street urchin. But as you move closer in towards the Boss's inner circle, there are items that only certain people can access - dirty money, cars, guns, secrets. The closer you get to the Boss, the more limited the scope of access to those items. Any item that is directly local to the Boss, is not accessible by anyone outside of himself.

    <h1>Reflection on Shareef's Fireside chat</h1>

    <h2>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>
    I really like the holistic approach to learning. I went to a Rudolf Steiner school, which has many holistic education philosophies, so it is a comfortable way to learn for me. 
    I liked the Shareef talked about fears and acknowledging them. Everyone has fears of some sort, even if we're not aware of them, and they make us feel vulnerable. But by embracing this vulnerablity, and not running from it, we can grow and learn and become stronger.

    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>
    The first impression I got from going to the interview and meeting people who work at EDA was that everyone had great energy and enthusiasm for the work. I really appreciate that and it infected me with enthusiasm to get started. 
    Another impression is that it's going to be a lot of hard work, but it's going to be worth it!

    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>
    I'm really looking forward to engaging with it. Through my degree in speech language therapy I had to do many reflections, and I am a big proponent of mindfulness and being self-aware. 
    And I want to learn everything I can. I'm so excited to get into all this new knowledge. 
    </p>

    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>
      No they haven't changed. I also expected it to be a lot of work, and I always expected it to an exciting endeavour. And those expectations have just been reaffirmed. 
    </p>

    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>Have I mentioned already that I'm excited? Haha. The answer is yes! I really have been looking forward to this for a while now and it's great to finally get stuck in. 
    I'm not nervous at all. I know there will be challenges but that's all part of the fun.

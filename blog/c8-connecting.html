                    <h4>Growing Trust and Sincerity</h4>
                    <p>
                        This all comes down to empathy! And the need to be authentic. I reckon people have a pretty good sense of fakeness, but if you really approach something with sincerity and thoughtfulness, then people appreciate that. It's the old conundrum of needing to be sincere and trusting in order to create trust and sincerity in someone else. Who goes first?!! I guess this is where you just have to have faith in the process, and take that first step. Assume that the other person is worth of trust and sincerity, and then if they turn out to be a real dick you can re-evaluate and maybe use some Loving Kindness on them (see below).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Empathic Listening</h4>
                    <p>
                        Empathic listening is all about being mindful, curious and kind during a conversation. And the only way to get better at it is with practice. Unfortunately I haven't done any practice yet! But I really do think that we tend to forget a lot that other people are just people too, with their own struggles and motivations and everyone is trying their best to survive whatever is in front of them. So we need to practice more putting ourselves in others shoes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Loving Kindness Meditation</h4>
                    <p>
                        I found doing this meditation with someone in mind who I already cared a lot about less satisfying in a way, because it was so easy and I tend to have those thoughts and feelings about them anyway. The real juicy part was trying to do it for someone I didn't like at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is actually something I've tried to do in the past in a less formal way, particularly for those political leaders who don't share my views on what is important in creating a better world. I find it really difficult to tell myself that someone who does certain things that I disagree with is actually doing them out of the goodness of his heart and is worthy of kindness and happiness. But not believing that just makes the world a shitty place, so I kinda have to!

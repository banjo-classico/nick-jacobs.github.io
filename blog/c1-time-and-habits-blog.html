    <h1>Reflections on Time Management and Habit Techniques</h1>

    <p>I quite like the sound of the pomodoro technique and will definitely be impelementing that into my practice from now on. I think that would work quite well for me, and hopefully over time I will get better at knowing how many pomodoros I will need to complete something. 
    I really liked the idea of having a growth mindset or a fixed mindset and also that in order to be confident it's important to demonstrate that in small acts.
    The idea of starting small, and not trying to get to a big picture idea too quickly was also interesting and I think I definitely also want to get to the finish line much sooner that I really should.

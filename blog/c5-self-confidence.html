                    <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Search Inside Yourself explains that these are two terms that effectively talk about the same thing. And just comparing the two words 'aware' and 'mindful' can really illustrate that.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Try one self-awareness practice from the book (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Body scanning is something that I've done before, but normally for a shorter time span after a workout or a yoga session. I do find it really relaxing, but I've never tried to identify emotions in the body before. I feel like that will take quite a bit more practice.
                    </p>

                    <h4>"My emotions are not me!"</h4>
                    <p>
                        I really like this concept, especially the subtle shift from thinking "I am ..." to "I feel...". It allows one to still experience the emotion, as I believe we still need to acknowledge our emotions and let them run their courses through us, but it doesn't then consume us. It reminded me of the concept of people not being good or bad, but just doing good or bad things. Recognising that people can make mistakes, do bad things, but that doesn't necessarily change their underlying character. Likewise, people can get angry or sad, but that doesn't have to define them in any moment.

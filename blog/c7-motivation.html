                    <h1>Motivation</h1>
                    <h4>Pleasure, Passion, Purpose</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are three levels of happiness that we can attain in life, but they have differing levels of sustainability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pleasure is probably the easiest to attain, and the one that most people think will bring them happiness in life. But this is also the most short-lived form of happiness, which causes people to then have to find the next new thing to provide them pleasure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The happiness of passion is derived from finding something that you love to do and then doing that in life, and to a degree that is hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to be accomplished. This provides one with a sense of fulfillment which is longer lasting that pleasure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, there is happiness from purpose. This is the most sustainable and comes from taking part in something bigger than yourself, creating good in something that may not, and probably doesn't, revolve around you.
                    </p>

                        <li>Wholeheartedness</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Resiliency</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm a big believer in the importance of resiliency and have come across it in several different realms of both personal and professional life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In becoming a therapist, we learned that we needed to be resilient to the hardships of others and to the stresses of caring for those others, otherwise we wouldn't be able to do as good a job.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Likewise in our personal life, we need to be resilient to the emotional bumps and bruises that are unavoidable in life. Things don't always work out how we want but if we have resiliency then we can still succeed despite these setbacks.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         I think a big part of building resiliency comes from being mindful. If we are aware of our emotions, and aware of the antecedents, and we get perspective on everything going on, then often we can take actions to protect ourselves.

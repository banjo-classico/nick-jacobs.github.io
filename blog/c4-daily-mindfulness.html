                    <h3>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter III</h3>

                    <p>
                        I'm finding that having a moment of mindfulness each day is getting easier, in that I'm remembering to be mindful, but being mindful more than once a day is still a challenge. I find I almost need one of those alarms on my phone to remind me about it.
                        Doing the mindfulness conversation was an interesting experience. During my speech language therapy studies we learnt a lot about empathy, so had already had practice at summarising the gist of what someone has told me (At work I also find this a good strategy to avoid confusion or miscommunication!). But having to listen for a full four minutes without saying anything was a new experience. I'm not much of a talker, so being quiet isn't awkward for me, but I realised that I still like to respond to people in some way, either with a sound or a word or just something.  Having to keep that response until it was my turn, that was a strange feeling.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How can I sustain my mindfulness practice?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I like the idea of just needing to do one mindful breath a day. It goes back to that idea of creating habits by doing one really small thing and then building on it. One breath a day is so achievable! I think if I had a meditation buddy it'd also help. I've learnt that doing gym work with other people is what I need to actually get that done, so maybe meditation is the same.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Any other musings</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mindfulness is all about attention. At my current job I help people regain the ability to attend to things, so attention is definitely trainable. It's just about finding that one way to build the habit.

                    <h4>Choice</h4>
                    <p>
                        This chapter talks about self-regulation and really it all boils down to choice. We all have a choice about how to respond and react...if we are aware of our emotions and where they want to take us. If we can sense these emotions coming up in ourselves then we can choose how we let them affect us. We can go along with the emotion or we can simply let it go
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really like this idea of being able to let go of emotions that come over us. It is particularly useful when someone has done something completely idiotic which makes me really frustrated! If I can remember to just breathe, notice the emotion, but then let it go, I feel much better. And being frustrated wasn't going to fix the problem anyway.

                        This is a great method for responding to situations that make you frustrated or bring up other negative emotions.
                    </p>
                    <ul><li>Stop</li>
                        <li>Breathe</li>
                        <li>Notice</li>
                        <li>Reflect</li>
                        <li>Respond</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Stopping as soon as you recognise the emotion. Pausing to take a breath. Noticing the emotion in more detail, bringing attention to it. Then reflecting on why we're feeling the way we are. Then finally responding to it, hopefully in a positive way.

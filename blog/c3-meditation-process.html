                    <h1>The Meditation Process</h1>
                    <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
                    <p>I guess the concept allowed me to approach the task with freedom, knowing that I didn't have to have a finished or perfect product by the end of the week. So there was no stress when things didn't quite work the way I wanted, I just carried on and focused more on learning new things.</p>

                    <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</h4>
                    <p>
                      I've never really done meditation before, but I have read a lot about its benefits and never thought it was a useless thing to do.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What new things have you learned about meditation?</h4>
                    <p>
                      I guess one of the things that I hadn't read so much about was the link between meditation and increased happiness. I think calmness is more the common expectation from meditation, but I hadn't linked that in with happiness as such.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Not really any one in particular. Having not practiced meditation before, I'm open to trying all or any method.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                    <p>
                      I really liked the analogy of practicing meditation being like a work out for your attention. The idea that when your attention wavers and you bring it back, that's the moment when it can increase in strength (or focus).

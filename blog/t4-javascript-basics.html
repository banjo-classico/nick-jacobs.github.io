                    <h4>Javascript vs. HTML and CSS</h4>
                    <p>
                        HTML and CSS are more static languages that allow you to create the structure and style of something, but add no real dynamism to anything. That's where Javascript comes in! It gives functionality to your webpages, without which they would just be static pages that didn't change or do anything, but simply provided the user with some information. Javascript allows the website to be more interactive, and to change depending on the behaviour and input of the user.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Control Flow</h4>
                    <p>
                        Control flow refers to the flow through an algorithm or piece of code and how this is controlled. The most common device for controlling flow is the if/else statement. If one thing is true do this one thing, else if it is false do this other thing. In this way the steps of code are followed depending on what happens at each statement evaluation and allows for the flow to be diverted to different instructions depending on the outcome. Other control devices include loops and switches. A real life example of control flow might be cleaning the kitchen. For every dirty surface, spray on some cleaning product. Wipe once and check if it is clean. If not, wipe again. Repeat this process until surface is clean.

                    </p>

                    <h4>Arrays vs. object literals</h4>
                    <p>
                        Arrays store data in a sequenced order and to access that data you need to use square bracket notation and provide the correct index number to access the piece of data you want. Object literals on the other hand use key/value pairings to store data and this data is accessed by provided the key that matches the particular piece of data. This can be done using dot notation or bracket notation.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Functions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Functions are whole sections of code that do a particular task outside of the main control flow of the code. If the function is called the flow will go into the function and once completed will come out at the same point. Functions are useful for any tasks or actions that are going to be repeated a lot, which saves having to write out the code each time you want to do that task.

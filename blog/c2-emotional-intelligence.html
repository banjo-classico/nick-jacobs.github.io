            <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter I</h2>

            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p>
                I found it really interesting that a large corporation like Google recognised that there are more types of intelligence than just the typical IQ that people are familiar with. Emotional intelligence is just as important to being able to succeed in the tech world, because success ultimately still relies on group dynamics and working well together.

                I guess the most important take away message was that happiness is the key. If leaders create conditions that make people happy then those people will be more productive and successful. If we can develop ways of operating that create more happiness within ourselves, then we will also be more successful in all areas of life. I like this idea.
                And what makes it better is that happiness is not a static state. We can cultivate more a happier outlook by developing our emotional intelligence.

                The last point that stood out was that we experience emotions both mentally and physically, and in fact our physical responses to emotions often occur earlier than our conscious awareness of the emotion. This is where mindfulness comes in. If we can train our attention to recognise these physiological responses to emotions, then we can be more aware of how we are feeling and have more control over how we react to things.

            <h3>How was the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
            <p>
                I found that it was too difficult to stop my mind from wandering for even two minutes. As soon as I became calm and mind empty, some thought came flooding in and swept me off somewhere, and it was often a few moments before I became aware of it. I guess that's why people spend years practising it!

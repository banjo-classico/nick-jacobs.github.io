                    <h4>Compassionate Leadership</h4>
                    <p>
                        It's important to recognise that leadership does not necessarily imply that the leader is of a higher rank than those following. In fact plenty of good leadership comes from those around us, in the same boat as us, and conversely there are very many people in charge of others who demonstrate very poor leadership. Leadership, in my opinion, is getting people to move in the same direction, motivating people to accomplish things. This is often achieved by a manager or boss, but good leadership can come from anywhere.

                        In SIY, compassion is emphasised as THE main component of good leadership, and I would tend to agree. So much negativity in thought comes from the unknown. People are unsure about things, so they worry, they connect dots in their heads that don't really connect, they infer intent where there was none. People generally just want to be understood and want to be listened to. When that happens, things can generally be worked out, even if it doesn't always turn out the way people had initially wanted. Demonstrating compassion is a great way to listen to someone, hear them, and actually understand a bit about where they are coming from. This makes people happy, and happy people are more motivated!

                        Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness. These are five social domains that have a very strong influence over our behaviour and emotions through reward/avoidance mechanisms. In my own life I can certainly relate to many of these. Status is a particularly powerful one I think, but thankfully as I've grown older I've learned to be a lot more selective in the opinions that I value, so I tend to be less concerned with status. Nevertheless, it is always present to some degree.

                    <p>
                        In tackling something like Phase 0 of Dev Academy, I think status could have been a really influence player. You don't want to look too foolish or stupid in front of your classmates! But, as SIY mentions, if you turn it around into a challange against yourself, to master a skill, then it becomes a great motivator, and I feel that that is what is happening in our cohort. When everyone is supportive of others' learning, then we realise that comparing ourselves to others is a little useless, and instead we can focus on improving ourselves.

                        Of course, it helps knowing that we're all in the same boat, and hence have a greater relatedness factor, and this will hopefully enable us to create really good team work and trust within our cohort.

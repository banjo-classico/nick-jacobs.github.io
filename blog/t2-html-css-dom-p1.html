                <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and DOM?</h3>
                    <p>HTML is like the skeleton of a person, and CSS is like the appearance - hair, eye and skin colour; body shape; facial features; clothing etc. The DOM is like a set of habits or customs that the person follows, and which you need to know in order to interact well with the person. </p>
                <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
                    <p>The idea that everything on a webpage is separated out and contained within boxes.</p>
                <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
                    <p>The box model depicts a box around every element on a page and within that box there is the content, padding, border and margin, which can all be altered using CSS.</p>
